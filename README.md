 Dental X‑Ray Segmentation with Deep Learning

This project explores the use of deep learning for **tooth and structure segmentation** on panoramic dental X‑ray images.  
It uses a Jupyter notebook–based workflow with TensorFlow/Keras and related computer vision libraries.

 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Load and preprocess a dental panoramic X‑ray dataset
- Build and train a deep learning model for segmentation (teeth and surrounding structures)
- Evaluate model performance using common segmentation metrics
- Visualize model predictions against ground truth masks

The work is organized in a single Jupyter notebook so it’s easy to follow the full pipeline end‑to‑end.
